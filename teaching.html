	<h4> Spring 2023 </h4>
	<p>
		I continued to be the course champion for MA 107 and iterated on the design from the fall. We had common quizzes and exams this semester, and students had to earn their late passes for the homework by attending help hours. 
	</p>

	<p>
		MA 220 had three grade categories: weekly tutorial submissions, weekly concept checks, and projects. The tutorial submissions were graded on completeness and served to check if the students had been in class and followed the tutorials that I provided for their CAD software. The concept checks were weekly quizzes on Nuoodle over the mathematical material we covered. There were four projects over the course of the semester. These required students to create something unique in the CAD software and then explain the mathematics that they were using. Sometimes the math was explicit and other times it described methods that the CAD software was implementing behind the scenes. 
	</p>

	<p>
		The spring version of MA 107 was very similar to the fall. The major changes were that students needed to attend help hours to get extensions on their homework and we slowed the course down halfway through the semester after it became clear that students were not keeping up with the pace of lecture. We dedicated class days to reviewing for the exams. I would have students get into groups and work on the review together while I slowly revealed the key so they could check their answers. We also dedicated other class days to working on worksheets or other group activities to reinforce the material. 
	</p>

	<p>
		As I mentioned previously, MA 220 had three grade categories: tutorial participation, concept checks, and projects. In terms of class time, I lectured for about half the time, and had them working in the CAD software the other half of the time. Each of my mathematical lectures was followed up with by a CAD tutorial that covered how to use that math in their architectural software. I would also include challenge prompts asking them to create something in their CAD software that met specific criteria, but without giving them exact instructions. While the students were working on the tutorials, I would go around the class and give individual attention to students who needed help. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Every Thursday evening, students had to turn screenshots of their work, showing that they had completed the tutorial, including the challenges. I graded these on a completion basis and gave detailed feedback early in the semester while the students were figuring out what a complete submission looked like. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Each Monday students would have to complete a concept check on Nuoodle that covered the mathematical content from the previous week. I allowed the students multiple attempts on the concept checks and programmed the concept checks to give quick feedback. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Finally, there were 4 projects throughout the semester. For these projects, students had to turn in their CAD files and a document explaining their design choices and the mathematics underlying their design. I provided students with a detailed rubric for each project and with a template to base their write-up on. I gave students time in class to work on these projects and gave them the opportunity to show their early drafts for feedback. The day that the projects were due I had students do a “gallery walk,” where they went around and looked at each other’s work and got to ask each other questions about their projects. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Student response to the course was very positive, as evidenced by course evluations.
	</p>

	<h4> Fall 2022 </h4>
	<p>
		I served as course champion for MA 107. In that role, I worked with the other MA 107 instructors to get a consensus on the homework questions, quiz structure, exam questions, and on a common final exam. Students had access to late passes for homework and opportunities to retake quizzes for a higher grade. To reward growth, we wrote the final exam so that the different parts of it could replace earlier exams. Since Precalculus is a skills-based course, I think it is appropriate and rigorous to use students demonstrated abilities at the end of the semester to adjust their grade. 
	</p>

	<p>
		In MA 308, I structured the course around inquiry-based learning. The text for the course had definitions and statements of theorems, but the students had to provide all the proofs of the results. To help the students organize their work and share the load of writing proofs, I had them collaborate to form a wiki. This is essentially a shared proof portfolio, where the students must correctly cite and link to the previous results and definitions that they reference. I gave feedback and revision opportunities on the students’ proof submissions. The ultimate score of a wiki submission was determined by its correctness, its clarity, and its completeness. To determine their grade, I balanced the score of the wiki against their level of participation in the course. 
	</p>

	<p>
		If they contributed a little bit each week to the wiki, presented proofs in class, joined class discussions, and completed the weekly reflection assignments, they would earn the exact grade of the wiki. If they under participated they would earn less than the wiki, and if they went above and beyond, they would earn more than the wiki. I updated the student’s participation and wiki scores, and the wiki feedback on a weekly basis. 
	</p>

	<p>
		MA 411 tasks the student to do research, write up their results, and present their findings. The write up and presentation are scored by other department members based on a common rubric. To supplement this, I provided weekly benchmarks to the student, which accounted for a portion of the grade. 
	</p>

	<p>
		I provided a detailed syllabus and a calendar at the start of the semester listing the topics and assignments we were going to complete. I clearly labelled the Nuoodle site with what was due/available when and I kept the Nuoodle gradebook up to date. 
	</p>

	<p>
		To facilitate MA 107, I distributed note outlines through OneNote with placeholders for the terms we were going to define and the examples we were going to cover. For MA 308, we followed the inquiry based textbook and I would post messages to the class reminding them on what they were expected to have read/attempted before the next class meeting. 
	</p>

	<p>
		MA 107 has many topics to cover in a single semester. To accommodate this, I lectured most class periods, stopping as much as I could to give the students time to try examples on their own in a think-pair-share model. In contrast, most of the time in MA 308 students worked as a class to figure out the proofs for the results in the text. I would guide the discussion and act as a scribe, copying their ideas onto the board as they suggested them, or following the steps of their classical constructions in either <a href = "https://www.geogebra.org/">https://www.geogebra.org/</a>, or late in the course in <a href= "https://www.cs.unm.edu/~joel/NonEuclid/">https://www.cs.unm.edu/~joel/NonEuclid/</a>. I also set aside time in MA 308 for each student to present at least two complete proofs to the class. I would then guide a class discussion over the presentation using the “compliment sandwich” as a framework. 
	</p>

	<p>
		For MA 107, their grade was computed as a weighted average of homework, quizzes, and exams. The homework was online and had instant feedback. They could try any problem as many times as they want, until they get it correct. I graded every quiz and exam problem on a 4-point scale: 0 for no correct work, 1 for some progress, 2 for significant progress with a major flaw, 3 for a nearly correct solution, and 4 for a completely correct solution. Students had one retake opportunity for the quizzes and the final exam was written in five parts. Each of the first four of those parts could replace the corresponding exam, provided the students had done better on the final. The coarse grading scale requires students to know what they are doing to succeed in the course, and the retake opportunities and exam replacement policy gives them time to develop that competency with feedback. 
	</p>

	<p>
		In MA 308, I used the score for the wiki that class created together along with the students’ individual participation score to determine their course grade. If they contributed a little bit each week to the wiki, presented proofs in class, joined class discussions, and completed the weekly reflection assignments, they would earn the exact grade of the wiki. If they under participated they would earn less than the wiki, and if they went above and beyond, they would earn more than the wiki. I updated the student’s participation and wiki scores, and the wiki feedback on a weekly basis. 
	</p>

	<p>
		For both courses, I updated the Nuoodle gradebook on a weekly basis. When I returned quizzes and exams to the MA 107 students, I provided detailed feedback so they could learn from their mistakes and do better on their next attempt. In MA 308, class participation was largely a completion grade, and I gave feedback if students were losing participation points by not contributing enough to the wiki or if they were writing one sentence responses to the weekly reflection assignments as opposed to a more thoughtful answer. They were allowed to revise their wiki submissions based on my feedback, and I posted updated wiki scores on a weekly basis, so they could see what they needed to work on. 
	</p>

	<p>
		As I discussed above for MA 411, I provided a weekly schedule of benchmarks for the student to reach and had the other department use the official rubric to grade their paper and presentation. The student had access to the schedule of benchmarks and the criteria for the paper and presentation from the start of the semester. I also gave them templates for both the paper and the presentation. 
	</p>
	
	<h4> Spring 2022 </h4>
	<p>
		I continued to teach MA 232 in roughly the same way as previous semesters, continuing to emphasize real-world applications and the use of technology. This semester, students were able to do their quizzes and exams in class, though I continued to use the Pearson platform for homework and practice. 
	</p>

	<p>
		I approached MA 220 from a project based perspective. Students were given short homework assignments and quizzes to check their baseline knowledge, and then longer form homeworks involving applications and 3 group projects which tested deeper, more involved applications of the material. These projects were individualized and students were required to both write up their solutions and present them to the class.The projects consisted of using specific construction tools to achieve a non-trivial geometric effect, using trigonometry to solve land surveying problems, and applying the principles of perspective to fully analyze pieces of perspective artwork. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Just as in previous semesters, a detailed syllabus and schedule were handed out to students at the start of the semester and I kept the Nuoodle course up to date and organized. With MA 220, I did not have all of the materials created ahead of time, so especially in the last third of the semester I was updating the material about a week before we covered it in class. The first quiz of the semester was once again a syllabus quiz. 
	</p>

	<p>
		In MA 232 I assigned weekly homework through Pearson, gave weekly quizzes on Nuoodle, and we had 3 exams and a cumulative final exam. For each class day I prepared note outlines for the sections that were broken into theory and example portions. The idea was to do a mini-lecture on the big idea of the section and then let students work in groups or pairs on the examples. We would then come together as a class and discuss the problems. This worked well for at least one student who wrote on the course evaluation: 
	</p>

	<p>
		“His pacing was good - one can take notes, while still getting through a lot of material every class.” 
	</p>

	<p>
		 Before each exam I made sure that practive tests and formula sheets were available to the students. I encouraged students to complete the practice exams by giving them bonus points on the exam for completing the practice. 
	</p>

	<p>
		For MA 220, I provided students with note outlines for each day of class, and then after we completed a unit I would post complete notes for the topic. In a typical week students we assigned a long homework (due at the start of the next week) which consisted of an applied problem that would take some time to solve, a short homework (due Thursday night) reinforcing the lecture with multiple choice or fill in the blank questions, a skill check (due Friday night on Nuoodle), and a reflection prompt (also due Friday night). Students had unlimited attempts on the short homework, the long homework and skill check were graded for completeness and correctness, and the reflection was a participation grade. 
	</p>

	<p>
		There were also three projects assigned throughout the semester, two of which were group projects and one of which was individual. Students had to both write up their projects and present them to the class. Their project scores were then a combination of the peer evaluation of their project and my evaluation. Both the peer score and my score came from a rubric of completeness, correctness, and clarity. To balance the group work aspect of the projects, I also had students give their team mates a score of 1 – 5 indicating how well they participated. I then used that score to modify the group project score and assign individual grades. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Finally, when it became clear that the class had uniformly struggled with some of the long homework assignments, I created 3 bonus long homework opportunites that students could use to replace their lower scores. This at least had a positive impact, with one student reporting 
	</p>

	<p>
		“The other thing that was very helpful is we were always giving ample opportunity to improve our grade by doing bonus homework. Even though it was more homework, I was grateful to have this opportunity.” 
	</p>
	
	<h4> Fall 2021 </h4>
	<p>
		 continued to iterate on my course design for MA 101, expanding on the elements of formative assessment in the course and refining the choice of projects. We continued to use real world inspirations for all of the projects, and the quizzes were done mastery style. One change I made was that students had to clear certain criteria in order to turn in their projects. Specifically, they had to have reached a certain quiz average for the unit and they had to have made a rough draft of the project. 
	</p>
	<p>
For MA 306 I designed the course around in-class presentations of proofs, quizzes, and a proof portfolio. Each week students were assigned a unique problem relating to the material. They had three weeks and two revision attempts to make a final draft of their proof/solution. Through this the students learned the LaTeX typesetting language and they were forced to improve their mathematical content and their writing style. 
	</p>

	<p>
		As in previous semesters, I provided a detailed syllabus and a calendar at the the start of the semester listing the topics and assignments we were going to complete. I clearly labelled the Nuoodle site with what was due/available when and I kept the Nuoodle gradebook up to date. In MA 306 I had students make their own OverLeaf account for submitting proof portfolio pieces and I communicated feedback to them through their individual proofs. 
	</p>

	<p>
		We were able to meet in person for most classes this semester. To facilitate the class I distributed note outlines with placeholders for the terms we were going to define and the examples we were going to cover. I split the note outlines into a short lecture portion and then a worksheet of activities meant to reinforce the lecture. The students would work on the activities in groups or pairs and then we would discuss them as a class. After we finished a section, I would post the complete lecture notes for students that either missed class or had a hard time taking notes in the moment. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Both MA 101 and MA 306 had weekly quizzes/skill checks and opportunities to retake a modified version of those skill checks. These skill checks were graded without much opportunity for partial credit, but the opportunity to retake meant that students could improve their scores by looking at their feedback and trying again. I also continued my habit of having the first quiz be a syllabus quiz. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Homework consisted of weekly suggested practice prolems and then a reflection assignment where students reported back what they tried, what they succeeded at, and what they struggled with. I then used this feedback to help steer the course discussion and review topics. 
	</p>

	<p>
		For MA 101, the majority of their grade came from the projects, similar to spring 2021. I added options for the projects, so students could choose between 1 of 2 prompts. In addition to requiring students to check in about their projects, I also mandated that they maintain a certain quiz average in order for me to accept their submission. If a student had not maintined their quiz average, I would take the opportunity to meet with them one on one, schedule them to retake the relavant quizzes, and given them an extension on the project. This came with a 10 point penality on the project, but ultimately improved their course grade and ensured that the project earned a higher grade than it would have on their first attempt. As evidence that this policy helped I refer you to the following student comment on the course evalution: 
	</p>

	<p>
		“I didn't feel the class was very useful to me and I shot myself in the foot with that mentality, but at the end of the day Professor Holshouser didn't give up on me and hung with me till the end.” 
	</p>

	<p>
		In MA 306, in place of exams I had students create proof portfolios over the course of the semester. Each week they were given a unique prompt. They then had three weeks to create their final submission to that prompt and share it with me on overleaf. If they shared it earlier I would look their submission over and provide feedback, simulating the role of a reviewer for a journal. If at any point I declared the proof “accepted” they would earn an A on the proof. Otherwise I applied a rubric accounting for the completeness, correctness, and clarity of the proof. Students responded well to this, saying in the course evaluation: 
	</p>

	<p>
		“I liked the no exams, it was helpful to learn what I did wrong and then get to fix it instead of just getting bad grades. Holshouser was very available if the students needed help and I always left office hours with no problems.” 
	</p>

	<p>
		To assist students in learning LaTeX, the first proof portfolio assignment was simply to recreate a sample pdf using links to the tutorials on overleaf. 
	</p>
	
	<h4> Summer 2021 </h4>
	<p>
		I picked up some asynchonronous online Calculus 2 and Intermediate Algebra courses. These were already fully designed and supported with videos, otherwise I could not have kept up with the work. I viewed my primary role in these courses as setting clear expectations, keeping the students on schedule, and being there for them when they had questions. I held a couple office hours every weekday and a fair number of students showed up with questions. This is not my favorite way of teaching: asynchronous and compressed are challenging for students, but I believe I did the best I could with the limited time and resources.
	</p>
	
	<h4> Spring 2021 </h4>
	<p>
		I lucked out and once again taught two sections of MA 101 (Mathematics: A Liberal Art) and one section of MA 232 (Elementary Statistics). I was happy for this opportunity to directly iterate on these classes. This semester was remote the whole time, but was initially planned to be hybrid at some point. In anticipation of the hybrid part (that never actually happened), I initially had the students broken into three groups and each group had one day a week to show up online and work through activities together. They were assigned videos to watch and problems to work through on the other days. When it became apparent that we were going to be remote all semester, I had everyone come in on the same day, and used the other two days a week for extended office hours. Those office hours came in handy as the students were guaranteed to be available at those times. For MA 232 I streamlined the topics we were covering and shortened the videos by a good amount. For MA 101, I made the class project based instead of exam based. This approach fit that style of class better and allowed us to dig deeper into applications. Once the students learned what a project was supposed to look like, they turned in some really interesting and good work. I need to tweak my rubrics and the instruction pages for the projects a bit, but I'm overall very happy using projects for MA 101.
	</p>

	<h4> Fall 2020 </h4>
	<p>
		I taught two sections of Mathematics: A Liberal Art (MA 101 A and B) and two sections of Elementary Statistics (MA 232 F and G) in a hybrid format. For me, that meant that the course material was be available online and we met in smaller groups throughout the week to do activities related to the course material. After thanksgiving, we were completely remote. This was my first semester at Norwich, so I didn't have much time to prepare for these courses. I spent a lot of time making videos to support the classes. Some students loved the videos and particularly like being able to pause and go back. Others did not like the videos. The small group discussions in class were effective overall, and doing the exams and quizzes online freed up class time. Some of my videos for statistics were too long and MA 101 does not feel like a class that works well with exams.

	<h3>Teaching at the University of South Alabama</h3>
	<section>

	  <h4> Spring 2020</h4>
	  <p>
		I taught two sections of <a href="https://www.southalabama.edu/colleges/artsandsci/mathstat/syllabi/ma126.html">Calculus II</a> and two sections of <a href="https://www.southalabama.edu/colleges/artsandsci/mathstat/syllabi/ma120.html">Calculus and its Applications</a>. Prior to spring break, these classes went essentially the same as they had before. After spring break we were remote for Covid and everything changed. Some students adapted well, but it was difficult to maintain participation and engagement.
	  </p>
	  <h4>Fall 2019</h4>
	  <p>
	    I taught two sections of <a href="https://www.southalabama.edu/colleges/artsandsci/mathstat/syllabi/ma113.html">Pre-Calculus Trigonometry</a>, one section of <a href="https://www.southalabama.edu/colleges/artsandsci/mathstat/syllabi/ma120.html">Calculus and its Applications</a>, and one section of <a href="https://www.southalabama.edu/colleges/artsandsci/mathstat/syllabi/ma126.html">Calculus II</a>. The Trigonometry course was fairly standard and heavily coordinated. There wasn't really enough material to fill a semester, so some strange topics got covered in the end. Although there wasn't much room for changing the course up, mini lectures with think-pair-share seemed to do a good job overall. Calculus and its Applications is essentially business calculus. The topics are a bit of a mixed bag. In particular, I will never feel comfortable teaching material related to economics.
	  </p>
	  
	  <h4>Spring 2019</h4>
	  <p>
	    I taught one section of <a href="https://www.southalabama.edu/colleges/artsandsci/mathstat/syllabi/ma112.html">Pre-Calculus Algebra</a>, one section <a href="https://www.southalabama.edu/colleges/artsandsci/mathstat/syllabi/ma125.html">Calculus I</a>, and two sections of <a href="https://www.southalabama.edu/colleges/artsandsci/mathstat/syllabi/ma126.html">Calculus II</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    I feel like Pre-Calculus Algebra went much better this time around, even though it had a 6:00 PM meeting time. I was better able to convey to the students that we were in this together, and that I was there to help them succeed. I taught using a combination of slides and handouts, giving the students time to sit and attempt problems quietly before pulling the class back together to discuss. I didn't have any issues with covering the required material doing this even though it would seem to take more time. It also led to noticeably better discussion and engagement than I had seen when I did not give this time. Homework, quizzes and exams were run through MyLabsPlus, so I did not have much control over those aspects of the course. In the future, I would like to make the breakout, work, and then discuss idea even more explicit and structured. My course evaluation for Pre-Calculus Algebra is below.
	  </p>
	  <ul>

	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    I ran Calculus I mostly off of the resources I built in the fall, with some minor tweaks. I placed Newton's method immediately after linearization to emphasize the approximation idea inherint in both topics. I also updated the problem sets to better assess the intended topics. The other major change I implemented was to turn review sessions into group work days. That went so much better than me trying to review at the board that I don't think I am every going back. Another change I made was to use appoint.ly to have students scheule office hours vists. This completely solved the problem from the fall of students bunching up at the last moment to do test corrections. Many students do procrastinate and put things off, but appoint.ly shows them what times have already been booked, so the timing of the procrastination is pushed forward to the latest available office hours time. I had a really good batch of students this time around, sprits and motivation were high essentially all semester. I don't have too much else to say, other than that the success of this run of Calculus 1 emphasizes my point about the value of being able to iterate on a course design. My course evaluation for Calculus I is below.

	  <ul>

	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    The structure of my Calculus II courses were essentially the same as my Calculus 1 course. The major challenge for Calculus II was creating  a reasonable sequence of topics from the mess that is our text/base curriculum. I decided on four fundamental units: integration techniques, applications of integrals, series, and then power series. The idea is to use the techniques in the various applications so as to reinforce them. Power series are motivated by the need to approximate integrals which do not have closed forms. This then necessitates new ideas about convergence which takes us through sequences and series. One change I anticipate making it so move improper integrals from the techniques portion to the series portion, right before the integral test. A colleague who tried this experimental order out with me did that and it seemed to go better. Some benefits of this order: First off, I was able to come up with some really good assessment techniques. Matching problems between integrals and techniques, set-up but do not solve application problems, and having the students build their own series flow chart to use on exams. It was pretty easy to design exams which featured problems of varying difficutly in each of the topics. I had never really been able to do that before in a course, and I think it did a nice job of making it possible to earn a C/B What I mean to say is it created a space between perfect mastery and failure without giving partial credit or curving. I still think the list of topics for Calculus II is fundamentally flawed and a lot of what I did was put lipstick on a pig. My course evaluation for Calculus II is below.

	  <h4>Fall 2018</h4>
	  <p>
	    I taught two sections of <a href="https://www.southalabama.edu/colleges/artsandsci/mathstat/syllabi/ma237.html">Linear Algebra</a> and two sections of <a href="https://www.southalabama.edu/colleges/artsandsci/mathstat/syllabi/ma125.html">Calculus I</a>.

	  <p>
	    I inherited the Linear Algebra course from Dr. Clontz and Dr. Lewis. Following our official university educational improvement program, they redesigned the course using team based learning. The course also used standards based grading and elements of inquiry based learning. It takes a moment to sell the students on these various elements at the start of the semester. Some students are resistant to working on teams in particular. Most students, however, adapted to the structure of the course quickly, and seemed to thrive in it. This was the first course I ever taught that used team based learning, so I struggled to find the balance between lecturing and letting the students learn on their own. In other words, I probably lectured too much, but it's just so much fun to talk to students about dimension. A lot of things about this course brought me joy. Teaching four classes a semester can be exhausting, but I usually left these classes more energetic than when I started them. It was nice to be able to iterate on a designed course. When Dr. Clontz and Lewis first did the Linear Algebra redesign, the student success rate was around 70 percent. As of the spring semester of 2019, the course has a 95 percent student success rate. In terms of mastery, On average, students show complete competency twice on 21 out of 22 topics. This level of success has been across five different instructors. I think part of the reason for the success is that we came together every semester to talk about what worked with the course, what didn't, and how it can be improved. A cool thing happened with this course. I had students who had me for calculus III follow me to differential equations and then this linear alegbra course. It was really awesome to see them grow over these three courses. It also scares me that I am responsible for a huge chunk of their mathematical education. My course evaluations for linear algebra are below.

	    My design for the calculus I course was a bit of a compromise between traditional methods those I applied in linear algebra and differential equations. The course meets five days a week, and the students meet with a TA for the tuesday and thursday classes. For the TA sessions, I applied aspects of team based learning. The students were in persistant groups, worked on problems related to the most recent lecture, and the TA was there to go around and help as needed. I tried my best to make the lecture more interactive as well, giving the students the time to work out problems before asking them to follow along with me on the board. I didn't always have the time to do this as well I would have liked, but I still got more student interaction than I had in previous lecture style courses. The course was traditionally graded, but I built in a form of test corrections as an element of standards based grading. The lectures, homework, and exam reviews were all built according to learning objectives I set for the course before the semester started. Every exam problem lined up with one of the learning objectives. For the corrections process, students could come to office hours, show me their corrected exam, and then take a quiz with problems from the learning objectives they had missed points on. Each learning objective they showed mastery of got htem credit back on their exam. I also drastically reduced the amount of partial credit in the course. Half of each exam would be problems that are either correct or incorrect, no partial credit at all. The other half would be more traditional free response, but students can only earn a 0, 1, 4, or 5: 'completely wrong', 'somewhat correct', 'mostly correct', and 'completely correct.' This scale was used for all quiz problems and free response exam problems. I used mylab math for online homeowork so that students had some form of practice with feedback. Quizzes were used to give feedback on the students ability to write a complete solution. Even though there was little to no partial credit, the corrections allowed students to come out of the course with reasonable grades. I had a bit of a problem organzing office hours with this class as students would all want to do their corrections at the last minute. The course evaluations for calculus I are below.

		  I taught two sections of <a href="https://www.southalabama.edu/colleges/artsandsci/mathstat/syllabi/ma238.html">Differential Equations</a> and two sections of <a href="https://www.southalabama.edu/colleges/artsandsci/mathstat/syllabi/ma112.html">Pre-Calculus: Algebra</a>.

		  For the differential equations courses I used standards based grading and lecture. We were still working out some of the kinks in the standards based grading workflow, so there was a ton of paperwork to juggle, but other than that the semester went really well. I felt confident that the grades I was assigning were representative of the students dispayed ability and knowledge. Standards based grading allowed students the time to master some of the more tricky methods, and allowed me to ask some really invloved modeling problems in a proctored envirnomnet. On reflection, I did not like splitting the material up into first order methods, second order methods, systems of differential equations and then Laplace Transforms. In particular the method for solving linear first order equations is subsumed by the methods for higher order linear equations. I think the course would be have a more coherent narrative if the complexity of the differential equation was considered first and then the degree of the equation. We would then also have more time to discuss applications, visualization and approximation. Dr. Lewis and Dr. Clontz used this re-ordering in his version of the course when they taught it in the fall of 2018 and the spring of 2019 and seem happy with it. In all honesty, the differential equations curriculum is probably a bit too focused on techniques and not focused enough of the more qualitative aspects of the material. My course evluations are below.

		  The pre-calculus: algebra courses were heavily coordinated by Sonna Farmer. Homework, quizzes, and exams are all administered through myLabsPlus. I have to thank Sonna for assembling all of this as it meant the I did not have to assemble my own materials for the course or spend time grading material from the course. The downside of all of this that I had to lecture in a way that was lined up with the material on myLabsPlus. The lectures were a good excuse to get really good at using tools like Desmos and Geogebra and to have really good board work with lots of different colors. One of my classes for this course met in a large lecture hall where the only real way to administer the course was to lecture from a podium and draw on the screen. I definitely struggled to keep student attention and interaction in this environment.

		<h4>Fall 2017</h4>

		  I taught three sections of <a href="https://www.southalabama.edu/colleges/artsandsci/mathstat/syllabi/ma227.html">Calculus III</a>. I taught these sections traditionally with lecture, homework, quizzes, and exams. Homework was assigned out of the book and I graded it by hand. This turned out to be a mistake as it took up a ton of my time and many students were using chegg or a similar resource to just copy solutions. The class met four times a week and went well, about as well as this format allows. While we did not cover Stoke's theorem in a way that allowed me to assess students on it, but we did talk about it and some students had very excited reactions. Below are my course evaluations from these three sections.
