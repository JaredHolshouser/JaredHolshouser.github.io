	  <h4>Fall 2018</h4>
	  <p>
	    I taught two sections of <a href="https://www.southalabama.edu/colleges/artsandsci/mathstat/syllabi/ma237.html">Linear Algebra</a> and two sections of <a href="https://www.southalabama.edu/colleges/artsandsci/mathstat/syllabi/ma125.html">Calculus I</a>.

	    I inherited the Linear Algebra course from Dr. Clontz and Dr. Lewis. Following our official university educational improvement program, they redesigned the course using team based learning. The course also used standards based grading and elements of inquiry based learning. It takes a moment to sell the students on these various elements at the start of the semester. Some students are resistant to working on teams in particular. Most students, however, adapted to the structure of the course quickly, and seemed to thrive in it. This was the first course I ever taught that used team based learning, so I struggled to find the balance between lecturing and letting the students learn on their own. In other words, I probably lectured too much, but it's just so much fun to talk to students about dimension. A lot of things about this course brought me joy. Teaching four classes a semester can be exhausting, but I usually left these classes more energetic than when I started them. It was nice to be able to iterate on a designed course. When Dr. Clontz and Lewis first did the Linear Algebra redesign, the student success rate was around 70 percent. As of the spring semester of 2019, the course has a 95 percent student success rate. In terms of mastery, On average, students show complete competency twice on 21 out of 22 topics. This level of success has been across five different instructors. I think part of the reason for the success is that we came together every semester to talk about what worked with the course, what didn't, and how it can be improved. A cool thing happened with this course. I had students who had me for calculus III follow me to differential equations and then this linear alegbra course. It was really awesome to see them grow over these three courses. It also scares me that I am responsible for a huge chunk of their mathematical education. My course evaluations for linear algebra are below.

	    My design for the calculus I course was a bit of a compromise between traditional methods those I applied in linear algebra and differential equations. The course meets five days a week, and the students meet with a TA for the tuesday and thursday classes. For the TA sessions, I applied aspects of team based learning. The students were in persistant groups, worked on problems related to the most recent lecture, and the TA was there to go around and help as needed. I tried my best to make the lecture more interactive as well, giving the students the time to work out problems before asking them to follow along with me on the board. I didn't always have the time to do this as well I would have liked, but I still got more student interaction than I had in previous lecture style courses. The course was traditionally graded, but I built in a form of test corrections as an element of standards based grading. The lectures, homework, and exam reviews were all built according to learning objectives I set for the course before the semester started. Every exam problem lined up with one of the learning objectives. For the corrections process, students could come to office hours, show me their corrected exam, and then take a quiz with problems from the learning objectives they had missed points on. Each learning objective they showed mastery of got htem credit back on their exam. I also drastically reduced the amount of partial credit in the course. Half of each exam would be problems that are either correct or incorrect, no partial credit at all. The other half would be more traditional free response, but students can only earn a 0, 1, 4, or 5: 'completely wrong', 'somewhat correct', 'mostly correct', and 'completely correct.' This scale was used for all quiz problems and free response exam problems. I used mylab math for online homeowork so that students had some form of practice with feedback. Quizzes were used to give feedback on the students ability to write a complete solution. Even though there was little to no partial credit, the corrections allowed students to come out of the course with reasonable grades. I had a bit of a problem organzing office hours with this class as students would all want to do their corrections at the last minute. The course evaluations for calculus I are below.

	  	<h4>Spring 2018</h4>
		<p>
		  I taught two sections of <a href="https://www.southalabama.edu/colleges/artsandsci/mathstat/syllabi/ma238.html">Differential Equations</a> and two sections of <a href="https://www.southalabama.edu/colleges/artsandsci/mathstat/syllabi/ma112.html">Pre-Calculus: Algebra</a>.

		  For the differential equations courses I used standards based grading and lecture. We were still working out some of the kinks in the standards based grading workflow, so there was a ton of paperwork to juggle, but other than that the semester went really well. I felt confident that the grades I was assigning were representative of the students dispayed ability and knowledge. Standards based grading allowed students the time to master some of the more tricky methods, and allowed me to ask some really invloved modeling problems in a proctored envirnomnet. On reflection, I did not like splitting the material up into first order methods, second order methods, systems of differential equations and then Laplace Transforms. In particular the method for solving linear first order equations is subsumed by the methods for higher order linear equations. I think the course would be have a more coherent narrative if the complexity of the differential equation was considered first and then the degree of the equation. We would then also have more time to discuss applications, visualization and approximation. Dr. Lewis and Dr. Clontz used this re-ordering in his version of the course when they taught it in the fall of 2018 and the spring of 2019 and seem happy with it. In all honesty, the differential equations curriculum is probably a bit too focused on techniques and not focused enough of the more qualitative aspects of the material. My course evluations are below.

		  The pre-calculus: algebra courses were heavily coordinated by Sonna Farmer. Homework, quizzes, and exams are all administered through myLabsPlus. I have to thank Sonna for assembling all of this as it meant the I did not have to assemble my own materials for the course or spend time grading material from the course. The downside of all of this that I had to lecture in a way that was lined up with the material on myLabsPlus. The lectures were a good excuse to get really good at using tools like Desmos and Geogebra and to have really good board work with lots of different colors. One of my classes for this course met in a large lecture hall where the only real way to administer the course was to lecture from a podium and draw on the screen. I definitely struggled to keep student attention and interaction in this environment.

		<h4>Fall 2017</h4>
		<p>
		  I taught three sections of <a href="https://www.southalabama.edu/colleges/artsandsci/mathstat/syllabi/ma227.html">Calculus III</a>. I taught these sections traditionally with lecture, homework, quizzes, and exams. Homework was assigned out of the book and I graded it by hand. This turned out to be a mistake as it took up a ton of my time and many students were using chegg or a similar resource to just copy solutions. The class met four times a week and went well, about as well as this format allows. While we did not cover Stoke's theorem in a way that allowed me to assess students on it, but we did talk about it and some students had very excited reactions. Below are my course evaluations from these three sections.
