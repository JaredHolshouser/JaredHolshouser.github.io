<p>
I received my Bachelor's in Mathematics from the University of Texas in 2010. While there I focused on analysis and partial differential equations. I am currently pursuing a PhD in mathematics at the University of North Texas, with a focus on set theory.
</p>

<p>
My areas of research are descriptive set theory, inner model theory, the axiom of choice, and non-standard analysis.
</p>
  
<p>
Outside of math, I attempt to be a bit of a cinephile, and I like to read about physics, evolutionary biology, and ancient languages. The last movie I watched was Hell or High Water.
