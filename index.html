While there I focused on analysis and partial differential equations. I then recieved my Masters degree and PhD from the University of North Texas. My Masters project was to modernize the proof that the Axiom of Choice is independent from the Boolean Prime Ideal theorem. For my doctoral dissertation I studied infinite combinatorics under the axiom of determinacy, i.e. definable infinite combinatorics. I worked as a non-tenure track assistant professor the University of South Alabama from fall 2017 up to summer 2020. While there I focused my mathematical research on set theoretic topology and I began to learn about all kinds of different teaching strategies. I am currently a tenure track assistant professor at Norwich University.

      I am an assistant professor of mathematics at Norwich University. My academic interests (in no particular order) are math education, set theory, topology, and geometry. I was trained in descriptive set theory in graduate school at UNT. At the University of South Alabama, I transitioned into topology and became more interested in math education. I became a project NeXT fellow (Silver 2019) to improve my teaching. Now I am at Norwich University, where I continue to work on these pursuits.

I have taught courses along the entire undergraduate mathematics curriculum, from introductory courses, through the calculus sequence, differential equations, and linear algebra, and proof based courses including geometry, discrete math, and abstract algebra. I have also taught both introductory and advanced probability and statistics. I have guided independent studies in applying abstract algebra to chemistry, stochastic process and interpolation, analytic geometry, and hyperbolic geometry.

I have a consistent research program focusing on a subfield of topology called selection principles. Mostly my work has focused on establishing relationships between selection games and on building up the tools to more quickly establish those connections. I am currently looking for avenues where I can apply my mathematical skills more directly to the world. I have earned an excellence in research award from Norwich University.

As an assistant professor, I serve on a variety of committees at the departmental, college, and university level. I also am an academic advisor to 17 students currently.

      At the University of South Alabama I collaborated with Dr. Steven Clontz on the <a href="https://mappmath.org/programs/challenge/" target="_blank">MaPP challenge</a> and other puzzle events. This is an annual day long puzzle hunt for high schoolers built by mathematicians across the country. The puzzles don't assume any advanced mathematical knowledge, but still showcase topics in higher math that are currently being researched. The MaPP challenge also includes a GPS scavenger hunt element. I hope to bring this event to Norwich Univeristy.

    Outside of math, I attempt to be a bit of a cinephile, and I like to read about physics, evolutionary biology, and ancient languages(and recently board games). You can find my CV/resume <a href="Jared_Holshouser_CV.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
