While there I focused on analysis and partial differential equations. I then recieved my Masters degree and PhD from the University of North Texas. My Masters project was to modernize the proof that the Axiom of Choice is independent from the Boolean Prime Ideal theorem. For my doctoral dissertation I studied infinite combinatorics under the axiom of determinacy, i.e. definable infinite combinatorics. I worked as a non-tenure track assistant professor the University of South Alabama from fall 2017 up to summer 2020. While there I focused my mathematical research on set theoretic topology and I began to learn about all kinds of different teaching strategies. I am currently a tenure track assistant professor at Norwich University.

      My training is in set theory, analysis and descriptive set theory. I am currently applying my understanding of those areas to problems in set theoretic topology. I am interested in understanding topologicayl properties through games and different kinds of strategies for those games. The framework of games can capture the size of a space, covering properties, density properties and can even be used to connect spaces to their corresponding function and hyperspaces.

      At the University of South Alabama I collaborated with Dr. Steven Clontz on the <a href="https://mappmath.org/programs/challenge/" target="_blank">MaPP challenge</a> and other puzzle events. This is an annual day long puzzle hunt for high schoolers built by mathematicians across the country. The puzzles don't assume any advanced mathematical knowledge, but still showcase topics in higher math that are currently being researched. The MaPP challenge also includes a GPS scavenger hunt element. I hope to bring this event to Norwich Univeristy.

    Outside of math, I attempt to be a bit of a cinephile, and I like to read about physics, evolutionary biology, and ancient languages(and recently board games). I also have a <a href="http://jholshouserlst.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Research Blog</a> (which I need to update more frequently). You can find my CV/resume <a href="Jared_Holshouser_CV.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
