While there I focused on analysis and partial differential equations. I then received my master’s degree and PhD from the University of North Texas. My master’s project was to modernize the proof that the Axiom of Choice is independent from the Boolean Prime Ideal theorem. For my doctoral dissertation I studied infinite combinatorics under the axiom of determinacy, i.e. definable infinite combinatorics. I worked as a non-tenure track assistant professor the University of South Alabama from fall 2017 up to summer 2020. While there I focused my mathematical research on set theoretic topology and I began to learn about all kinds of different teaching strategies. I am currently a tenure track assistant professor at Norwich University.

      I am currently an assistant professor of mathematics at Norwich University. My academic interests are math education, set theory, topology, and geometry. I was trained in descriptive set theory in graduate school at the University of North Texas. At the University of South Alabama, I transitioned into topology and became more interested in math education. I became a project NeXT fellow (Silver 2019) to improve my teaching. I continue to work on these pursuits at Norwich University.

I have taught courses along the entire undergraduate mathematics curriculum, from introductory courses, through the calculus sequence, differential equations, and linear algebra, and proof-based courses including geometry, discrete math, and abstract algebra. I have also taught both introductory and advanced probability and statistics. I have guided independent studies in applying abstract algebra to chemistry, stochastic process and interpolation, analytic geometry, and hyperbolic geometry.

I have a consistent research program focusing on a subfield of topology called selection principles. Mostly my work has focused on establishing relationships between selection games and on building up the tools to establish those connections more quickly. I am currently looking for avenues where I can apply my mathematical skills more directly to the world. I have earned an excellence in research award from Norwich University.

As an assistant professor, I serve on a variety of committees at the departmental, college, and university level. I am also an academic advisor to 17 students.

     Recently, I've trained myself in the tools and theory of data analysis. I am become proficient in using SAS, Python, R, SQL, and Power BI to clean, analyze, summarize, and present data. I have also learned the fundamentals of relational database theory and data normalization.

    Outside of math and data, I enjoy watching movies, playing the piano and trumpet, reading, learning about science and history (and science history!), and hiking. You can find my CV/resume<a href="Jared_Holshouser_CV.pdf" target="_blank"> here</a>.
