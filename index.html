  I recieved my Bachelor's in Mathematics from the University of Texas in 2010. While there I focused on analysis and partial differential equations. I then recieved my Masters degree and PhD from the University of North Texas. My Masters project was to modernize the proof that the Axiom of Choice is independent from the Boolean Prime Ideal theorem. For my doctoral dissertation I studied infinite combinatorics under the axiom of determinacy, i.e. definable infinite combinatorics. I am currently working at the University of South Alabama as an assistant professor.
</p>

<p>
  From a set theory standpoint I am not only interested in continuing to explore definable combinatorics, but in the relationship between definable and traditional infinite combinatorics, and what that can tell us about the relationship between universes of choice and universes of determinacy. Carried over from my undergraduate studies I am still interested by analysis and in particular in the applications of descriptive set theory to analysis. I have also explored non-standard, or Robinsonian, analysis.
</p>

<p>
Outside of math, I attempt to be a bit of a cinephile, and I like to read about physics, evolutionary biology, and ancient languages. I also have a Research Blog. You can find my CV/resume here.
