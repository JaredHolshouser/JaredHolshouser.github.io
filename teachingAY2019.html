	  <h4> Spring 2020</h4>
	  <p>
		I taught two sections of <a href="https://www.southalabama.edu/colleges/artsandsci/mathstat/syllabi/ma126.html">Calculus II</a> and two sections of <a href="https://www.southalabama.edu/colleges/artsandsci/mathstat/syllabi/ma120.html">Calculus and its Applications</a>. Prior to spring break, these classes went essentially the same as they had before. After spring break we were remote for Covid and everything changed. Some students adapted well, but it was difficult to maintain participation and engagement.

	  <h4>Fall 2019</h4>
	  <p>
	    I taught two sections of <a href="https://www.southalabama.edu/colleges/artsandsci/mathstat/syllabi/ma113.html">Pre-Calculus Trigonometry</a>, one section of <a href="https://www.southalabama.edu/colleges/artsandsci/mathstat/syllabi/ma120.html">Calculus and its Applications</a>, and one section of <a href="https://www.southalabama.edu/colleges/artsandsci/mathstat/syllabi/ma126.html">Calculus II</a>. The Trigonometry course was fairly standard and heavily coordinated. There wasn't really enough material to fill a semester, so some strange topics got covered in the end. Although there wasn't much room for changing the course up, mini lectures with think-pair-share seemed to do a good job overall. Calculus and its Applications is essentially business calculus. The topics are a bit of a mixed bag. In particular, I will never feel comfortable teaching material related to economics.
